SQUARE ROOT DECOMPOSITION
--> Query optimisation
--> Reduces the time complexity of the query from O(n) to O(sqrt(n))

Steps:
1) Divide the array into blocks of size sqrt(n)
2) Preprocess the blocks and store the results in an array (eg: sum of elements in each block)
3) Query L to R, combine answers from blocks and get the final answer

MO'S ALGORITHM
--> Offline queries- queries are given in advance and reordering of queries does not affect the answer
--> No update queries
